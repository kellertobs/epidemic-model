Exploratory ODE model of epidemic spread for 2019/2020 coronavirus outbreak in the UK and abroad.

The model is of the SIR-model type, in this instance solving for the variables of susceptible fraction of population (S), currently infected fraction (I), recovered fraction (R), and case fraction resulting in death (D). The simulation code is written in the form of a Jupyter notebook (Python 3.7).
